# TQ-combination：TargetLynx (Waters, US) output files combination tool
The TargetLynx (Waters, US) software is a widely used tool for peak identification and compounds quantification of UPLC-TQ/MS instruments. Currently, the multiple output files (.txt) of this software cannot be applied directly for data analysis. Researchers have to spend a lot of time for format conversion and data combination.
A based software named “TQ combination” was developed by using C# in Visual Studio platform. The input of this soft are the .txt files provided by TargetLynx (1 file per sample) and the output is 4 .csv files with peak area, peak height, peak response and concentration respectively, of all the samples. The output files can be imported into universal data analysis softs such as SPSS, SIMCA, R, matlab, Graphpad and so on.
The GUI based software is green and doesn’t need any installation.
